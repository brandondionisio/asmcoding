 #    Summary: Assembly for the initialization of      #
 #             registers and the calling of the main   #
 #             function found in calc40.ums. This      #
 #             function sets aside r6 and r7 as temp   #
 #             registers and sets r0 to always hold    #
 #             the number 0.                           #
 #                                                     #

 #                                               #
 #  - r0 is zero                                 #
 #  - r1 holds the return address                #
 #  - r2 holds endstack pointer (call stack)     #
 #  - r3 and r4 are general purpose registers    #
 #  - r5 holds endvalstack pointer (value stack) #
 #  - r6 and r7 are temporary registers          #
